androidlogger
=============

A simple wrapper for android.util.Log.

Theoretically, everyone should use android.util.Log.isLoggable() to check whether one can log at the specified level, with
the specified tag. 

Practically, everyone either skips the step or has his own wrapper that delegates the logging to the android.util.Log
only in some circumstances (BuildConfig.DEBUG flag, some resources available only in specific build flavor etc.)

I've created my own wrapper, ALog, that has API compatible in 100% with android.util.Log class, but adds a setter for
minimum log level. Now you can set a minimum log level in runtime, whenever you want, to whatever value you'd like to.

I used AOSP source code (specifically, android.util.Log) class as a base.
